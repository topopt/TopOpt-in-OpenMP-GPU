# GPU Accelerated Topology Optimisation Based on OpenMP Target Offloading
This repository contains an implementation of a topology  optimisation solver for linear  elastic compliance minimisation in three dimensions. The implementation is based on OpenMP target offloading to one GPU.

## Linear MBB Beam Example
The result after 20 design iterations can be seen in the folloowing figure.

## Compilation
Even though OpenMP offloading to GPUs is supported by a wide range of compilers such as LLVM/Clang, ROCm, ICPC, NVC, and GCC, the compilers do not support the same subset of the OpenMP specification. We used NVIDIA's NVC compiler from the NVIDIA HPC SDK. The OpenMP directives may need to be adjusted if you choose to use another compiler.

### Dependencies
We used the following versions of the `cholmod` library and the `nvc` compiler.

| **Pachage**           | **Version** | **Installation** |
| :---                  | :---        | :---           |
| `SuiteSparse/CHOLMOD` | 5.1.2       | [See Github release notes](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/releases/tag/v5.1.2) |
| `nvhpc`| 22.5 | [NVIDIA HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-hpc-sdk-releases)|
| `CUDA` | 11.1 | [CUDA Toolkit 11.1.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.1.0-download-archive?target_os=Linux) |

To load the dependencies, you may adjust the module names in `setup_gbar_env.sh`. To load the modules and update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, run the following command.
```bash
$ source setup_gbar_env.sh
```

### Compiling the Project
After loading the modules and updating the dynamic link loader path, you may simply compile the project with
```bash
$ make
```
Note that the project has been tuned for an NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU which has compute capability `-gpu=cc80`. For an NVIDIA Tesla V100, the compute capability must be adjusted to `-gpu=cc70`. 
## Running the Code

To run 20 iterations of the code on a grid of 128 times 64 times 64 voxels and save the result you may use the following commands:
```bash
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=12
$ export OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=MANDATORY
$ export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
$ ./top3d -x 16 -y 8 -z 8 -l 4 -w 1
```
In the above example, we specify that we wish to use four levels in the multi-grid preconditioner with `-l 4`. Therefore we must divide the domain size by 2^l-1 to find the size of the coarsest grid which the application takes as input. 

### Inputs and Options
The following table includes a list of all the available options.

| **Option** |                                          **Description**                                     | **Default Value** |
